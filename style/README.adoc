= Style

If you're working on the static styling of Site's pages, follow these
instructions to get set up.

If you want to write a re-frame app or similar, you'll need to set that up
yourself as the instructions will be different.

== Setup for development

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#installing-tailwind-css-as-a-post-css-plugin

Currently, we're doing the 'Installing Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin'
approach.

----
npm ci tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest postcss-cli@latest
----

NOTE: See https://stackoverflow.com/a/48524475 for why you should use `npm ci`
rather than `npm install`.

== Building the CSS

----
./css build
----

== Uploading to your Site instance

There's a https://github.com/babashka/babashka[bb] script that will upload your CSS build to Site

----
./css upload
----


== Notes

[NOTE]
--
I created the tailwind with

----
npm tailwindcss init
